      <h1>Technology Standards, Market Cycles, and Investment Returns</h1>
<p class="subtitle">November 16, 2017</p>

<p>Information technology evolves in multi-decade cycles of expansion, consolidation and decentralization. Periods of expansion follow the introduction of a new open platform that reduces the production costs of technology as it becomes a shared standard. As production costs fall, new firms come to market leveraging the savings to compete with established incumbents on price, pushing down margins and decentralizing the supply side of the market.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>The price drop attracts new users, increasing the overall size of the market and creating new opportunities for mass consumer applications. Entrepreneurial talent moves to serve the new markets where costs are low, competition is scarce, and the upside is high. Often these early entrepreneurs will introduce new kinds of business models, orthogonal to existing ones.</p>

<p>Those who succeed the most and establish successful platforms “on top” of the open standard later tend to consolidate the industry by leveraging their scale (in assets and distribution) to integrate vertically and expand horizontally at the expense of smaller companies. Competing in this new environment suddenly becomes expensive and startups struggle to create value in the shadow of incumbents, compressing venture returns.</p>

<p>Demand then builds for a low cost, open source alternative to the incumbent platforms, and the cycle repeats itself: the new open standard emerges and gets adopted, the market decentralizes as new firms leverage the cost savings to compete with the old on price, value creation shifts upwards (once more), and so on.</p>

<p>(Introduce market cycles and open source as the driver of booms)</p>

<p>We’ve seen this pattern play out over the different cycles in information technology. In the 1950’s the transistor collapsed the production cost of electronics by replacing expensive vacuum tubes with smaller, cheaper and more reliable switches, giving birth to the modern computer industry that eventually consolidated around IBM.</p>

<p>In the 1970’s, the microprocessor (new platform) collapsed the production cost of computers by reducing expensive, bespoke CPU systems down to a single, small general purpose processor that was easy to mass produce. New firms came to market leveraging the microprocessor to compete with IBM in a movement that brought us the minicomputer, the PC, laptops, mobile phones and all the new “things” on the internet.</p>

<p>As the hardware layer decentralized and became more competitive (compressing margins, and thus prices), new value creation moved up to the software layer. Cheaper computers attracted more users, which created new demand for software services and in particular a shared operating system. Microsoft took advantage of that opportunity by creating a proprietary operating system and securing a distribution advantage through lock-in contracts with manufacturers. They then leveraged this position to consolidate the industry by building more functionality into Windows and competing directly with some of its most successful applications. By the late 90’s, we’d gone from hundreds of PC software companies to essentially one.</p>

<p>What undid that consolidation was the combination of Linux and the Web (HTTP), both of which surfaced around 1991. Microsoft’s business depended on proprietary software and expensive retail distribution. Linux provided a free, open source operating system, and the Web a marginally free distribution network (software is just data, after all). As before, new firms came to market leveraging the standard to compete with Microsoft on price (e.g. Red Hat), while new value creation moved out of the software business and into online networks.</p>

<p>Out of the dot-com boom, bust, and phenomenal growth that followed Linux and HTTP, came some of today’s most important companies: Google, Amazon, Facebook, eBay, Twitter, PayPal, Netflix, to select a few. With little leverage left in proprietary software, it was bargained away in exchange for user networks from which a company might extract uniquely valuable data to monetize in some other fashion, significantly expanding the potential universe of services.</p>

<p>(Introduce the great bundling)</p>

<p>Where we are today deserves a few paragraphs. The market is now consolidating around Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon at an incredible pace and the cost of innovation for younger companies is increasing as it becomes more expensive for smaller companies to compete and create independent value.</p>

<p>(Links paragraph, or graphic)</p>

<p>Even larger, more established companies like Snapchat and Spotify are feeling the pain. As an example, it took 7 years for Snapchat to build a 150 million user base for disappearing photos and stories; it took Facebook less than a year to surpass that with Instagram stories, limiting Snap’s ability to build a large advertising business. And Snap is an established, public company with a large balance sheet – smaller players are not as equipped to navigate the threat.</p>

<p>(Investment returns)</p>

<p>Finding venture-scale returns on the web going forward is going to be difficult. The sheer scale in distribution of the incumbents is simply too expensive to overcome without a radical shift in market structure and business models. The way to play a consolidating market is to invest heavily into the consolidating incumbents (which are likely to continue growing strongly for a long period of time) and to invest progressively in the insurgent platforms that will grow to commoditize the incumbent business models and create a new wave of innovation. We are focused on the latter.</p>
